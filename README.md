🧠 Concepts Used
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Classes (student, studentmanagementsystem) encapsulate functionality and data.

List Management
All student records are stored in a list for in-memory access.

Input Validation (basic)
Uses basic input types and prompts to guide users.

Functions & Loops
Efficient use of loops and conditional logic for control flow.

🛠 How to Run
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

Save the script as student_management_system.py.

📌 Use-Cases
Ideal for beginners learning Python and OOP concepts.

Can be expanded into a full-fledged application with file/database integration.

Good for understanding basic CRUD logic implementation.

🚀 Future Improvements (Optional)
Add data persistence using files or a database (SQLite, MySQL).

Include input validation and error handling.

Add a GUI using Tkinter or a web interface using Flask.
